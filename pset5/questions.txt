8.  The unload function is still slow, and I dont no right now how to make it faster. But I will be back for this pset to make it better.
9.  nothing. It's take me a week to understand th idea of linked list and implement it as now )) I need to learn deeper the recursion to faster my unload function, but for now it's done
10. yes. upload function.
